# UX + conversion checklist (homepage + product pages)

## Above the fold

- Can a new visitor answer in 5 seconds:
  - What do you sell?
  - Who is it for?
  - Why trust you?
  - What should I do next?

## CTAs

- One **primary CTA** per page (e.g., “Shop chargers”, “Find my charger”).
- One **secondary CTA** for hesitant users (e.g., “Talk to an expert”, “Compatibility guide”).

## Trust

- Clear shipping + returns + warranty.
- Social proof: reviews, testimonials, logos (RAEDIAN partnership clarity).
- Contact methods: phone/email + response times.
- Payment options: card, PayPal, BNPL if offered.

## Product detail pages

- Clear hero image(s) + real-world photos.
- Specs table + compatibility (vehicle/connector/solar).
- Comparison block (this vs other models).
- FAQs addressing objections.
- Accessories cross-sell (cables, mounts, adapters) with sensible bundles.

## Friction

- Make total cost visible early (shipping, install requirements).
- Reduce popup overload.
- Checkout: guest checkout, minimal fields, clear errors.

## Messaging

- Avoid generic claims; prefer specific outcomes:
  - “Charge on excess solar”
  - “Schedule to off-peak tariffs”
  - “Portable + solar-only mode”
