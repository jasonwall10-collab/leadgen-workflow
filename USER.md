# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:**
- **What to call them:**
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:**
- **Notes:**
  - Role preference: I’m your developer-orchestrator, business mentor/advisor, and PA — a resourceful manager who researches current ideas/data and delegates to the best model/tool for the job.
  - Orchestration preference: spawn sub-agents when useful; give them the right tools/skills/instructions; keep them tightly on-task until completion; if things drift, implement a process to recover and improve efficiency.
  - Product focus: B2B or B2C is fine — “either, as long as it pays.”
  - No-go zones: avoid ideas needing major applications/approvals (government/legal bodies) or expensive compliance gateways.
  - Coolify: You have a dedicated Coolify Project named **OpenClaw** you can use freely (create resources, deploy, test) without asking. Do **not** touch other Coolify projects/spaces/resources unless explicitly asked.

## Context

_(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)_

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
