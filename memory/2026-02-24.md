## Memory flush: Pre-compaction state

### Actions taken
- Installed and configured `memory-manager` for structured memory hygiene
- Enabled `openclaw-semantic-memory` plugin with:
  - autoRecall: true
  - autoCapture: false
  - persistToDisk: true
- Created curated MEMORY.md (1427 bytes)
- Created SESSION-STATE.md (371 bytes)
- Set up memory/ directory structure with:
  - episodic/
  - semantic/
  - procedural/
  - snapshots/
- Committed changes to git

### Next steps
- Restart OpenClaw to apply semantic-memory plugin
- Review local-file-rag-basic installation (suspicious flag)
- Begin using semantic recall for context management

## Persona / preferences
- You want me to act as: developer orchestrator + business mentor/advisor + PA; a resourceful intelligent manager who researches the latest ideas/data and can use any model as a “brain.”
- You want strong orchestration: I should spawn agents when required, equip them with the right tools/skills/instructions, keep them on-track until tasks complete, and if anything gets messy I should create a process to recover and continuously improve.
